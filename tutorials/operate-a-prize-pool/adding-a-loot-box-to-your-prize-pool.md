# üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Add a Loot Box

You might want to add a Loot Box to your Prize Pool, so that anyone can add more prizes without permission.

A Loot Box can be attached to any NFT: in fact, all NFTs already have a loot box!

You can look up the Loot Box address for an NFT using the Loot Box Controller. See the [Networks](https://github.com/pooltogether/documentation/tree/6c30eec9a3787b298b041b5d864e955c716185ba/networks.md) page. To transfer any tokens held by the Loot Box to the owner of the NFT you call the `plunder` function.

For more information see the [documentation](../../protocol/lootbox.md) and the code[ on Github](https://github.com/pooltogether/loot-box)
