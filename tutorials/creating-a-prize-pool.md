# Create a Prize Pool

The easiest way to create a prize game is by using our [Builder App](https://builder.pooltogether.com).  The Builder app is supported across all testnets.  The Builder is an interface to the [Compound Prize Pool Builder](../protocol/builders/compound-prize-pool-builder.md).

You can call the on-chain Builder such as the [Compound Prize Pool Builder](../protocol/builders/compound-prize-pool-builder.md) directly.

Otherwise, customize and deploy the core [PoolTogether Pool Contracts](../networks.md).  Source code is on [Github](https://github.com/pooltogether/pooltogether-pool-contracts).
