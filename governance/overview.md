# 🏛️ Overview

_The PoolTogether protocol will be transitioning to decentralized governance. In the meantime, the core team serves as the interim governance body._

PoolTogether Governance broadly serves two mandates:

* Protocol improvement
* Prize Pool management

## Protocol Improvement

Governance will guide the evolution of the protocol towards the goal of building products that create financial health. The primary functions of governance are to:

* Set [rewards](untitled.md) for prize pool users
* Approve & implement new yield sources for prize pools 
* Implement new prize strategies

In addition to these core functions governance may:

* propose integrations with L2 systems
* Add additional prizes or rewards 
* subsidized transactions
* insurance coverage
* Anything else! 

All Prize Pools created with [Builders](../protocol/builders/) contribute a small fee to the **protocol reserve**. The reserve is retained by the protocol as sponsorship in the Prize Pool in which it accrued.

## Prize Pool Management

Governance also manages its own set of Prize Pools. These Prize Pools are displayed on the official [PoolTogether App](https://app-v3.pooltogether.com).

## Comptroller

All Prize Pools link to a global protocol [Comptroller](untitled.md). The Comptroller is owned by governance, and determines the reserve rate and rewards Prize Pools.
